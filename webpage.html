                <h2>Super Strength</h2>
                <p>The character was depicted as having the ability to move large vehicles, including cars, trains, and ships. Later on he was depicted jumping incredible heights holding cars, even before learning to fly.</p>

                <h2>Enhanced Leaping</h2>
                <p> could leap over an 8th of a mile or over a tall building. Later on he learned how to fly, first by maneuvering in mid-air and later on by completely countering gravity.</p>

                <h2>Mind Abilities</h2>
                <p>: though originally taking a simple and forceful approach to most problems in early stories, Superman's mind has just as much potential as his body in terms of abilities. He was capable of creating new materials for indestructible clothes which he used to make his uniform. He could memorize things with photographic accuracy and his mind and eyes could resist numbing substances even when the rest of his body caved in.</p>

        <div class="about-page-content">
            <p>Since 1938, Superman stories have been regularly published in periodical comic books published by DC Comics. The first and oldest of these is Action Comics, which began in April 1938.[1] Action Comics was initially an anthology magazine, but it eventually became dedicated to Superman stories. The second oldest periodical is Superman, which began in June 1939. Action Comics and Superman have been published without interruption (ignoring changes to the title and numbering scheme).[71][72] Several other shorter-lived Superman periodicals have been published over the years.[73] Superman is part of the DC Universe, which is a shared setting of superhero characters owned by DC Comics, and consequently he frequently appears in stories alongside the likes of Batman, Wonder Woman, and others.</p>
